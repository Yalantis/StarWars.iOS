This component implements transition animation to crumble view-controller into tiny pieces.

Also, read how it was done in [our blog](https://yalantis.com/blog/uidynamics-uikit-or-opengl-3-types-of-ios-animations-for-the-star-wars/)

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8
- Swift 4

## Installing with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'StarWars', '~> 2.0'
```

## Usage

At first, import StarWars:

```swift
import StarWars
```

Then just implement class of *UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate* that will return our animation form method *animationControllerForDismissedController* and assign it to *transitioningDelegate* of viewController that you want to dismiss.

```swift
override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
let destination = segue.destinationViewController
destination.transitioningDelegate = self
}

func animationControllerForDismissedController(dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
return StarWarsGLAnimator()
}
```

There are also two things you can customize in the Star Wars animation: duration and sprite sizes. 
Let’s see how you can do this:

```swift
let animator = StarWarsGLAnimator()
animator.duration = 2
animator.spriteWidth = 8
```

Have fun! :)

#### Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. 

P.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for iOS (Android) better than better. Stay tuned!
